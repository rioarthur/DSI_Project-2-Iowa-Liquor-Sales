### Iowa Liquor Sales Analysis

### Overview
The Iowa state government provided a particular dataset on their official website that shows liquor transactions for all state stores. Based on factors such as liquor bottle price and total bottles sold, we had to determine where is the best place to allocate a new liquor store.

### Analysis
Analysis was completed using linear regression and regularization (to reduce the Mean Squared Error).

### Conclusion
After conducting the linear regression model (and dropping Adair County for the dummy variables), the county that has the highest beta coefficient is Dallas County. Based on this model, we would say that opening a liquor store in Dallas County could potentially lead to more sales than opening a liquor store in other counties. Also, we would say that for each one unit increase in bottles sold and sale retail price, sales would increase by 14.29 and 2.34 dollars respectively.
